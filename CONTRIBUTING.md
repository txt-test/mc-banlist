To contribute additional bans, just open a pr with your changes. 
Please append the following stucture as a template, so the file is still a valid banned-players.json that can directly be deployed into use
You can also copy and paste the entries from your own banlist

{
    "uuid": "long format uuid",
    "name": "name of the player",
    "created": "2020-04-13 21:03:33 +0200",
    "source": "Server",
    "expires": "forever",
    "reason": "give a reason here"
  },
  
  Additionally include any proof you can offer to your pr
  
  If you are a player and you want to appeal your entry in the list, then you can also open a pr removing your entry and I will try to contact the person who originally added you
